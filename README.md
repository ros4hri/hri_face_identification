hri_face_identification
=======================

A [ROS4HRI](https://wiki.ros.org/hri)-compatible face identification package.
It is built on top of
[dlib's face recognition pipeline](http://blog.dlib.net/2017/02/high-quality-face-recognition-with-deep.html).
It performs face recognition at > 100fps on a GTX10xx generation mobile GPU.

Because this node is meant to be used in a broader face processing pipeline,
it does not perform face detection itself.
It expects instead faces to be detected and published under `/humans/faces/...`
(see below the list of subscribed topics).

## ROS API

### Parameters

All parameters are loaded in the lifecycle `configuration` transition.

- `model_path` (default: `model/dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat`):
  Path, absolute or relative to pkg share, to the trained dlib resnet face identification model to be loaded.
- `match_distance_threshold` (default: `0.5`):
  Distance threshold (in the face embedding space) to consider two faces to belong to the same person.
- `additional_face_database_paths` (default: `""`):
  A list of full paths to the face databases where known faces will be loaded from,
  in addition to the ones found under the [face_databases resource](#resources) and the `persistent_face_database_path`.
- `persistent_face_database_path` (default: `/tmp/faces_db.json`):
  Path where the collection of all known faces, including the ones discovered online, is stored at node shutdown.
  It gets loaded at startup in addition to the [face_databases resource](#resources) and the `additional_face_database_paths`.
  If empty, no database is saved and the online discovered faces are lost.
- `can_learn_new_faces` (default: `true`):
  Whether or not unknown faces will be added to the database.
  If set to false, only *previously identified* faces are recognised (and the face database will not be modified).
- `identify_all_faces` (default: `false`):
  Whether or not already-tracked faces are re-identified.
  If false, face identification is only performed when face id changes,
  i.e. a currently-tracked face will not be re-identified every frame.
  If true, all received faces (on `/humans/faces/<id>/aligned`) will run through face identification at every frame.
- `processing_rate` (double, default: 10.0):
  Best effort rate for processing input images in milliseconds.

### Topics

This package follows the ROS4HRI conventions ([REP-155](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0155.html)).
If the topic message type is not indicated, the ROS4HRI convention is implied.

#### Subscribed

- `/humans/faces/tracked`
- `/humans/faces/<face_id>/aligned`

#### Published

- `/humans/candidate_matches`:
  Correspondances between face IDs and (recognised) person IDs (alongside with a confidence level). 
  The `person_id` IDs are randomly generated when a new, unknown, face is detected.

### Resources

By default are loaded all the face databases registered under the resource type `face_databases`.
[resource](https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/blob/master/ament_cmake_core/doc/resource_index.md).
It expects [marker files](https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/blob/master/ament_cmake_core/doc/resource_index.md#marker-files),
containing the file database paths, separated in different lines, relative to its package share folder install path.
The faces database itself must be installed in such location.

The `hri_face_identification` installs in such a way a database for itself:
see the `CMakeLists.txt` how it is installed.

## Examples

### Identify faces

For an example of usage, execute in different terminals:
- USB camera:
  1. `apt install ros-humble-usb-cam`
  2. `ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe`
- HRI face detect:
  1. Either
    - if you are on a PAL robot `apt install ros-humble-hri-face-detect`
    - otherwise build and install from [source](https://github.com/ros4hri/hri_face_detect).
  2. `ros2 launch hri_face_detect face_detect.launch.py`
- HRI face identification:
  1. `apt install ros-humble-hri-face-identification`
  2. `ros2 launch hri_face_identification face_identification.launch.py`
- RViz with HRI plugin:
  1. `apt install ros-humble-rviz2`
  1. `apt install ros-humble-hri-rviz`
  2. `rviz2`

In RViz, add the 'Humans' plugin to see the detected faces.
The face IDs should be permanently assigned to the same people.

### Offline face database creation

Execute in different terminals:
- USB camera:
  1. `apt install ros-humble-usb-cam`
  2. `ros2 run usb_cam usb_cam_node_exe`
- HRI face detect:
  1. Either:
    - if you are on a PAL robot `apt install ros-humble-hri-face-detect`.
    - otherwise build and install from [source](https://github.com/ros4hri/hri_face_detect).
  2. `ros2 launch hri_face_detect face_detect.launch.py`
- HRI face identification recorder:
  1. `apt install ros-humble-hri-face-identification`
  2. For each person:
    - `ros2 run hri_face_identification db_record -n <person_name>` (use `--help` for additional arguments).
    - A camera image window should appear; selecting it use SPACE to start/stop recording a scene, ESC to terminate.
    - Record multiple scenes, each with at least 30 images and in a different lightning condition.
  3. The images are saved by default in `/tmp/face_dataset`

After the recordings are completed, the processed faces database is obtained executing
`ros2 run hri_face_identification db_process` (use `--help` for additional arguments).
By default it will read the persons facs images database from `/tmp/face_dataset` and
output a `/tmp/face_dataset/face_db.json` containing the anonymized face embeddings.
This file can be passed to the `hri_face_identification` node, along with others, through the `face_database_paths` parameter.
Check the terminal output to see the anonymous id mappings.
